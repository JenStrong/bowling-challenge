# Bowling Scoreboard

## Overview
This project was completed during my first two weeks of learning Javascript. This app calculates the score for a 10-pin game of bowling.

##Bowling Scoring - overview
A bowling game consists of 10 frames in which the player tries to knock down the 10 pins. In every frame the player can roll one or two times. The actual number depends on strikes and spares. The score of a frame is the number of knocked down pins plus bonuses for strikes and spares. After every frame the 10 pins are reset.
